# Delhi-Metro-Network-Analysis
Metro Network Analysis is the process of looking at the metro systems' network in order to comprehend its efficacy, efficiency, and structure. It generally looks at stations, routes, traffic, connections, and other operational details. 

Delhi Metro Network Analysis can help in several ways:
• Improve Efficiency: Identify bottlenecks and optimize scheduling.

• Optimize Routes: Enhance connections and reduce travel time.

• Enhance Passenger Experience: Adjust services based on flow patterns and peak times.

• Predict and Manage Demand: Forecast future needs for planning expansions.

• Reduce Operational Costs: Identify areas for cost-saving measures.

• Strategic Planning: Guide future development and network expansion.

• Safety and Security: Improve safety measures and emergency responses.

This is the Metro Network Analysis using python

using libs - pandas, folium , matplotlib

what kind of Analysis are done in this

→Distance Analysis:

Distribution of distances from the start for different lines.

Distribution of station opening dates. Number of stations opened each year. Geospatial Analysis:

Heatmap of station densities. Clustering of stations based on their geographical coordinates. Line Analysis:

Number of stations per line. Average distance between stations on each line. Correlation Analysis:

Correlation between distance from the start and other features like latitude and longitude.
